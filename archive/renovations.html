<BLOCKQUOTE>The Virginia Hills Club has launched a renovation campaign to
  renew our historic, 50-year old pool. Prior to the 2004 swimming season, the
  bathhouse and two pump houses will be renovated. Siding and new roof were placed on all three buildings, as well. In addition, the grounds were cleaned up and landscaped. Other changes are being made to improve the
  experience of members and visitors at our facility. The most noticeable addition for 2005 will be a <b><a href="http://www.vahillspool.org/WHAT.pdf">water slide
</a></b> above the diving well, which will provide a new, colorful and fun element to members' experience at the pool.
  <P>In the next few years, we anticipate putting a new deck around the two
  pools, reconstructing and repositioning the guard shack at the entrance, and
  conducting further landscaping. We are also working to locate additional
  recreational facilities on the grounds, including improved playground
  equipment, picnic shelters, a volleyball court and other facilities.
  <P>The New Virginia Hills Club is on the rise and we plan to keep serving the
  community for another 50 years.
