        Congratulations to Paige Collins, breaking a 20-year Tidal Wave record
        for 15-18 girls' butterfly. Paige's time was 33.19 yesterday, and the
        record from 1990 held by Anne Doucette is [was!] 34.83. Paige is in
        her first year in this age group, so expect her to beat her own
        record, and further solidify her name in our record books. She is a
        strong contender for NVSL All Stars this year. Go Paige!

        Paige Collins AGAIN set another new pool record for the 15 - 18 year
        old girls butterfly.  Paige lowered the record, which she set last week,
        by another 0:00.09.  Yes, Wonder Woman got a new costume and it's a Tidal
        Wave swim suit on Paige Collins! Congratulations again, Paige!
