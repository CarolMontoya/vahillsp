        Congratulations to Paige Collins, breaking a 20-year Tidal Wave record
for 15-18 girls' butterfly. Paige's time was 33.19 yesterday, and the
record from 1990 held by Anne Doucette is [was!] 34.83. Paige is in
her first year in this age group, so expect her to beat her own
record, and further solidify her name in our record books. She is a
strong contender for NVSL All Stars this year. Go Paige!
