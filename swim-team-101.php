          <p>
            Every swimmer's parent has experienced that first day
            of swim practice or that first swim meet where they
            wonder, why am I here and what's going on? We've all
            been there before and will be glad to enlighten you
            in your quest to understand the world of summer
            swimming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although this information is written for use by
            parents of new Virginia Hills Tidal Wave swimmers,
            the fundamentals are true for any area swim team. It
            will (hopefully) provide some information that will
            help you understand what is happening while your
            child swims. Please remember that the only stupid
            question is the one that is unasked. Your Team Reps,
            Coaches and fellow swim parents all want you to
            understand and enjoy our summer swim program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome to the Tidal Wave &ndash; we're glad to have
            you with us!

          <h5>
            Our Philosophy
          </h5>
          <p>
            We believe in establishing a healthy environment that
            encourages swimmers to do their best, recognizes
            their contributions, and is fun for the entire
            family. Our goal is that kids will enjoy the time
            spent developing their swimming skills and belonging
            to the team. Most of the kids don't care if we're in
            a top division or a bottom division. We'd all like to
            be division champions, which usually means going
            undefeated, but only one team out of six can usually
            claim this honor. Personal development is what is
            most important and for a swimmer that means improving
            your times.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've all taken our kids to soccer or other sports
            and probably stood by as two or three parents ran the
            team. Swimming isn't like that. You can't run a swim
            program without parental help. In fact, it takes over
            40 parents to time, officiate and score a typical
            swim meet, and that doesn't include pool set up and
            tear down or running the snack bar or non- swimming
            team activities. Coaches are the only paid staff for
            swim team -- everyone else is a volunteer. We value
            each other's contributions!
          </p>
          <p>
            Swimming is unique in that there's a place on the
            team for anyone eighteen or younger who can swim
            across the pool without assistance. How many other
            sports have kids five years old to eighteen years old
            and their parents on the same team participating in
            the same competition?
          </p>
          <h5>
            Expectations for Swimmers
          </h5>
          <p>
            Although swimming is considered an individual sport,
            our summer league is structured with an emphasis on
            the team. Any team is only as good as the people on
            it. In keeping with our philosophy articulated above,
            our expectations are simple:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Virginia Hills Swim Team is not a swim lesson
            program. A swimmer must be able to swim a length of
            the pool to join the team. We don't care how fast or
            how ugly or how legal the stroke is or how long it
            takes to swim that length. We'll help your swimmer
            become a better swimmer, but in fairness to the other
            swimmers on the team, we must insist that all
            swimmers be able to swim. Your child will feel better
            about his/her being on the team if he/she is
            competitive with most of the other kids of the same
            age.
            </li>
            <li>Keep your commitments: We're planning on you to
            swim at all the meets unless you tell us you're not
            available, preferably at least three days in advance.
            </li>
            <li>Pay attention to the coaches: With many swimmers,
            disruptions aren't fair to the other swimmers.
            </li>
            <li>Do your best- it's a lot more important than
            being the best.
            </li>
            <li>Have fun.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>
            Expectations for Parents
          </h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Pay attention to information from the team rep
            (usually via e-mail). There will be messages before
            meets with information about location and report
            time, swimmer selections (what stroke your swimmer
            will be doing), and volunteer assignments. Sign up
            with multiple e-mail addresses if you'd like!Let the
            team rep know in advance when you are unavailable.
            </li>
            <li>Keep your volunteer commitment (we need parents
            to run the meets).
            </li>
            <li>When volunteering on the deck (as a timer, for
            example) wear a plain white top (no writing or logos)
            and dark bottoms.
            </li>
            <li>Ask questions, of the team rep and other parents
            who are veteran swim team families. There is a lot to
            learn, we're all volunteers, and we want to make this
            as easy as possible!
            </li>

          <h5>
            Practices
          </h5>
          <p>
            Practice times are posted on the Swim Team Bulletin
            Board and in the summer swim season section of our
            web site. Swimmers should come to practice regularly
            and be prepared to do their best. It's important to
            attend morning practice sessions if at all possible.
            Afternoon sessions compete with club members' use of
            the pool, are crowded, and are not offered each day.
            Please work with your friends and neighbors to
            arrange car pools to help swimmers attend morning
            practice.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Swimmer Apparel
          </h5>
          <p>
            Swimmers should wear a swimsuit that will be
            comfortable for racing. The Tidal Wave, like every
            other swim team, has a team suit. The wearing of the
            team suit is optional. There is a culture shock for
            some boys to the coverage of jammers. Usually, when
            they realize that this type of suit is good for
            racing and everyone else is wearing one, their
            opposition breaks down. Although a team suit is not
            required, suits or caps with any logo other than
            Tidal Wave are not permitted (wearing a plain
            suit/cap is fine). Caps are not required, but
            recommended. Team caps can be purchased from the team
            rep. Most swimmers use goggles.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Accessories for the well-dressed swimmer
          </h5>
          <p>
            Every swimmer needs a towel, the bigger and thicker
            the better. Other accessories you should consider are
            goggles, a sweat suit (for cool days), a swim cap
            (especially for girls with long hair), a hat or other
            sun protection, flip-flops or some other sort of
            footwear, and a bag to carry everything. You should
            also have liquid refreshment (Gatorade, All Sport, or
            a water bottle) and a light snack for during the meet
            such as fruit, granola bars or other healthy foods.
            Save the sweets at the concession stand as a reward
            for swimming a great swim.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Buddy Program
          </h5>
          <p>
            Being a new kid on the swim team can be a bewildering
            experience. We've instituted a program to give every
            swimmer a Buddy to cheer them on at swim meets and
            help them adjust to their new experience.

            Let's cover a few organizational items, just to make
            sure we're in sync.

            Team Reps and Coaches
          </h5>
          <p>
            The people you'll run into the most in your swim team
            dealings are the Team Reps and the Coaches. The Team
            Reps are volunteer parents who were new to swimming
            at one time just like you are today. The Team Reps
            are responsible for running every aspect of the swim
            team and are the representatives of the Virginia
            Hills team to other swim teams and the NVSL. It's a
            job that is impossible to do successfully without
            help from a great many parents. The Team Reps hire
            the Coaches who are responsible to the team reps for
            the swimming portion of the swim team program.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Northern Virginia Swimming League (NVSL)
          </h5>
          <p>
            In 1956, 8 Northern Virginia Pools founded the
            Northern Virginia Swim League. Today, the NVSL has
            over 10,000 swimmers on 104 teams and is the largest
            summer swim league in the United States. Obviously,
            with this many teams, there has to be some division
            of teams. During the off season, the NVSL ranks each
            team from 1 to 104 based primarily on swimmers times,
            and then divides the teams, based on these rankings,
            into about 18 Divisions of five or six teams. This
            means that the fastest teams are in the lower
            numbered Divisions and the less competitive teams are
            in the higher numbered Divisions. The other teams in
            our division, and meet locations, are on the NVSL's
            Web site, <a href=
            "http://nvsl.nvblu.com/plasma/core/site/nvsl">http://nvsl.nvblu.com/plasma/core/site/nvsl</a>.
            Directions to pools are provided prior to the meet.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Dual Meets
          </h5>
          <p>
            The six teams in each division swim the other five
            teams, one at a time on five consecutive Saturdays,
            in a series of Dual Meets ("A" Meets), so called
            because there are two teams competing. Based upon the
            results of these five meets, a division champion will
            be named.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Relay Carnivals
          </h5>
          <p>
            Another NVSL event is the Division Relay Carnival,
            which takes place on the Wednesday between the third
            and fourth weeks of the season. All six teams in each
            division converge on one pool for an evening of relay
            races. These include both Freestyle relays (each
            swimmer swims the Freestyle) and Medley relays (each
            swimmer swims a different stroke). The next night,
            all the Division Coordinators meet and relay teams
            are selected to swim at the All-Star Relay Carnival
            the following week. The sole criterion for selection
            to the All-Star Relay Carnival is to have one of the
            eighteen fastest times in events swum in the Division
            Relay Carnivals.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Divisionals
          </h5>
          <p>
            The sixth week, each Division has an Individual
            Championship meet, commonly referred to as
            "Divisionals." Each team is allowed to enter two
            swimmers in each event and a swimmer can enter no
            more than two events. If a team does not have two
            swimmers for an event, the other teams can bid in
            other swimmers to fill the empty lanes. This is an
            individual meet and is not scored.
          </p>
          <h5>
            All Stars
          </h5>
          <p>
            After the Divisionals, all the Division coordinators
            meet to select swimmers for the All- Stars meet the
            following week. The sole criterion for selection to
            All-Stars is to have one of the eighteen fastest
            times swum that day in an event in the Divisional
            meet. All Stars can be overwhelming for a first time
            swimmer as approximately 600 swimmers plus parents,
            coaches, and officials converge on a pool for a meet
            that takes about six hours. If your swimmer is fast
            enough to be named an All Star, it is an thrill they
            will never forget.

          </h3>
          <p>
            If you're not a former swimmer, the strokes and their
            rules can be a cause of bewilderment. While the
            stroke rules are simple enough for a six year old to
            understand, most people do not have a copy of the US
            Swimming Rules, so we'll briefly describe the strokes
            below. The rules below are the US Swimming rules as
            modified for use in the NVSL. Teams in other leagues
            may have slightly different rules.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Freestyle
          </h5>
          <p>
            The freestyle is defined as any means of swimming
            across the pool. Any stroke and kick are acceptable.
            There are, however, a few don'ts associated with this
            stroke, specifically: (1) You cannot walk on the
            bottom or pull yourself along using the lane lines
            and (2) In a 50 Meter race (two pool lengths) you
            must touch the wall at the 25 meter end before
            touching the wall at the 50 meter end (This may seem
            obvious, but sometimes swimmers miss the wall at the
            turning end of the pool)
          </p>
          <h5>
            Backstroke
          </h5>
          <p>
            Like the freestyle, almost anything goes on the
            backstroke as long as you stay on your back. Watching
            swimmers learn the backstroke is a perverse sense of
            fun as they bounce off lane lines and wonder where
            they are. Eventually, they will learn to guide off
            the lane lines, use the overhead backstroke flags and
            the lane line markings to know where they're at in
            the pool, and count strokes from the flags to the
            wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Backstroke starts are different from all others
            because the swimmer is in the water feet planted
            against the wall, and hanging on to either another
            swimmer's legs or the lip on the pool awaiting the
            starter's signal. "Legs" must be grabbed below the
            knee. Persons serving in an official capacity (such
            as timers or coaches) may not serve as legs. If your
            swimmer backstrokes, he or she will eventually learn
            the backstroke flip turn. This is the one exception
            to staying on your back and can be used only as part
            of a turn (not a finish) at the pool wall.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Breaststroke
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Breaststroke has two components, the kick and the
            arm pull. The pull and its recovery must both be
            under the breast and cannot extend further back than
            the waist area. The kick is a "frog" kick and the
            toes must be pointed outward during the propulsive
            part of the kick. The arm pull and kick must be in an
            alternating sequence and the elbows must stay below
            the water except for tagging the wall at the finish.
            Breaststroke turns and finishes require a
            simultaneous two-hand touch.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Butterfly
          </h5>
          <p>
            A well-executed butterfly (or Fly) is the most
            beautiful exhibition of power you'll ever see in a
            swimming pool. Quite frankly, the fly is the hardest
            stroke for most swimmers to perfect and while they
            are learning it many look like they are drowning.
            There are two components of the fly; the arm pull and
            the kick. The arm pull must be an over the water
            recovery (the arm over the surface of the water from
            elbow to wrist) with the arms moving simultaneously.
            The kick is a dolphin kick with both legs moving
            simultaneously. Unlike the Breaststroke, there is no
            requirement to alternate the kick and pull. Turns and
            finishes require a simultaneous two-hand touch at the
            wall.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Individual Medley
          </h5>
          <p>
            The individual medley (or IM) is when an individual
            swims each of the four strokes in the sequence
            Butterfly, Backstroke, Breaststroke, Freestyle. We
            swim a 100 Meter IM, which means that 25 Meters, or
            one pool length, of each stroke is swum. In a 100
            Meter IM, every turn is a stroke change and stroke
            finish rules apply. This means no Backstroke Flip
            Turns.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Relays
          </h5>
          <p>
            There are two kinds of Relays, the freestyle relay
            and the medley relay. Both involve a team of four
            swimmers, each swimming one quarter of the total
            distance. In the freestyle relay, each swimmer swims
            the freestyle. In the medley relay, the sequence is
            Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly and Freestyle. At
            the NVSL Relay Carnival, swimmers eight and under
            swim a modified medley relay where the fly leg of the
            relay is replaced with a freestyle leg.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all relays, each swimmer must wait until the
            previous swimmer touches the wall prior to leaving
            the deck. Running starts or pushes from teammates are
            not allowed.

            There are two basic meets you will encounter as a
            parent: Saturday meets, which are scored dual meets
            and Monday Meets, which are un-scored dual meets.

            Saturday Meets
          </h5>
          <p>
            Saturday Meets consist of 38 Individual events and 12
            Relays. The events swum for each stroke and age group
            are shown below. Remember, each pool length is 25
            meters.

            <em>NOTES:</em>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>In Saturday dual meets, the youngest age category
            for the Butterfly is 10 and under. There is a 25
            Meter Butterfly for 8 &amp; under swimmers at
            Divisionals and All Stars.
            </li>
            <li>The order of events is to go down each column
            starting on the left side except that the mixed age
            relays are the last two events. To make it easier,
            buy a meet sheet.
            </li>
            <li>3. The Mixed Age Relays are swum by, in order, an
            11-12 year old, a 9-10 year old, a 13-14 year old,
            and a 15-18 year old.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>
            Who Swims?
          </h5>
          <p>
            These meets are to see who can score the most points,
            so the fastest swimmers get to swim. Three swimmers
            can be entered in each individual event and no
            swimmer can swim more than two individual events.
            Since swimmers take vacations and go places such as
            scout camp, and a swimmer can swim in only two events
            (plus relays) in any meet, you don't have to be one
            of the three fastest swimmers to swim in a Saturday
            meet. Who swims an event may seem to be a mystery.
            However, after the first meet both teams know the
            others swimmers times and we try to position our
            swimmers to optimize our points and win.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Disqualifications (DQs) and False Starts
          </h5>
          <p>
            A swimmer will be disqualified (or DQd) if he/she
            does not follow the rules of the stroke or false
            starts. These are covered in more detail in <a href=
            "#ch7">Chapter 7</a>.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Seeding
          </h5>
          <p>
            In Saturday meets, the home team has lanes 1, 3, and
            5 while the visiting team has lanes 2, 4, and 6. The
            fastest swimmers swim in lanes 3 and 4, the next
            fastest in lanes 1 and 2, and the next fastest in
            lanes 5 and 6. Swimmers are seeded based upon their
            fastest times attained in prior competition. Lane 1
            is always on the right side as you stand facing the
            pool at the starting end.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Meet Sheets
          </h5>
          <p>
            While all NVSL meets have an announcer, the best way
            to follow the meet is with a meet sheet, which lists
            all the events, swimmers, and seed times. Meet Sheets
            are usually found in the concession area and
            typically sell for a dollar or two.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Scoring
          </h5>
          <p>
            In the individual events, a first place finish earns
            5 points for the team, a second place 3 points and a
            third place finish 1 point. Relays are scored as 5
            points for the winner and 0 points for the loser.
            There are 402 points up for grabs in a Saturday meet.
            Unless there are one or more places not awarded in an
            event due to DQs or lack of swimmers, you need 202
            points to win.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a tie, the points for the places
            involved are equally split among the swimmers. For
            example, a two-way tie for second place, each swimmer
            earns 2 points (3 points for second plus 1 point for
            third equals 4 points, half for each swimmer). No
            third place would be awarded because the next swimmer
            is fourth. For a third place tie, each swimmer is
            awarded 1/2 point.

            Relay Carnivals
          </h5>
          <p>
            In Relay Carnivals, teams are not seeded. Each teams
            lane assignment for the first event is based upon
            luck of the draw and the teams then rotate one lane
            to the left after each event. The meet sheet lists
            only the team swimming in each lane in each event
            (except for All Star Relay Carnival).

          </h3>
          <p>
            Your first swim meet can be a bewildering experience
            as you encounter a vast horde of adults dressed in
            white tops. NVSL rules require white as the color to
            be worn by all officials. This is also practical as
            white is a good color to wear on a hot humid summer
            morning.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Clerk of the Course
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Clerk of the Course is the "gatekeeper" for all
            swimmers in our meets. The people who perform this
            function get the swimmers to the right lanes for the
            correct race. You can't run a race without swimmers
            and the clerk of the course makes sure the right
            swimmer gets to the right place at the right time.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Referee
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Referee is the chief official for each swim meet.
            He is responsible for the conduct of the meets and is
            the final authority on the interpretation and
            enforcement of all swimming rules. Prior to the start
            of each race, the referee sounds two or three short
            blasts to advise the participants to get ready. After
            the announcer or starter announces the event, the
            Referee sounds one long blast as a signal for
            swimmers to get into position for the start or to
            jump feet first into the water for a backstroke
            event. For Backstroke events, a second long blast is
            given to bring the swimmers to the wall for the
            start. When the referee sees that all the swimmers
            are ready, he extends his arm pointing towards the
            starter. At this point, the starter takes control.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Starter
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Starter is responsible for insuring that all
            swimmers are given a fair and equitable start. The
            starter will instruct the swimmers to "Take your
            mark". After all swimmers are ready and still, the
            starter will start the race, using a "Colorado
            System" (so called because it is built by Colorado
            Timing Systems). This system consists of a public
            address system. a horn, and a strobe light.
          </p>
          <p>
            A race can be recalled only if it was a bad start by
            the starter (i.e. not all the swimmers were ready) or
            for a safety reason. This is done using a recall
            signal on the Colorado system (you'll know it when
            you hear it). For more information, see False Starts
            in <a href="#ch7">Chapter 7</a>.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Stroke and Turn Judges
          </h5>
          <p>
            Once the race has started, the Stroke &amp; Turn
            Judges are responsible for insuring that all swimmers
            obey all the rules for the stroke that they are
            swimming. These people are always at the ends of the
            pool for starts and finishes and walk the sides of
            the pool as best they can within the physical
            constraints of the pool. If a Stroke and Turn Judge
            sees a violation of the rules, he raises his hand to
            signify that an infraction has occurred. A
            Disqualification is recorded on a DQ slip, which the
            referee reviews and approves and forwards copies to
            the Table workers and the Team Rep.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Marshall
          </h5>
          <p>
            Marshals are responsible for ensuring that Warm-ups
            are conducted safely and that order is maintained
            during the warm-ups. Duties include ensuring that
            diving starts are used in warm-ups only when a lane
            is one way away from the starting end, stopping any
            horse play and making sure swimmers aren't hanging or
            sitting on the lane lines.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Relay Take-off Judges
          </h5>
          <p>
            During relays, you'll see four Relay Take-off Judges
            at each end of the pool (two per lane). Their job is
            to ensure that each swimmer touches the wall prior to
            the next swimmer in the relay leaving the deck. Each
            Judge notes on a slip of paper whether each swimmer
            in his lane left before or after the swimmer in the
            water touched the wall. Relay Take-off Judges do not
            raise their hands when they observe an early take-off
            because a disqualification occurs only if both Relay
            Take-off Judges observed an early takeoff.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Timers
          </h5>
          <p>
            The timers are the most important people to every
            swimmer. They are the people who determine each
            swimmer's official time for each race. Being a timer
            is a good entry-level position for new parents to
            help out in. Some parents have been timers for years
            and wouldn't want to see a swim meet from any other
            viewpoint. If you can start and stop a stopwatch, you
            can be a timer. We'll even provide the stopwatch.
            Timers start their watches on the strobe light from
            the Colorado system and stop their watches when the
            swimmer touches the wall. There are three timers per
            lane and all three times are recorded. The middle
            time is the official time. The Chief Timer collects
            the time cards from the timers, reviews them for
            accuracy and completeness, and forwards them on to
            the table workers.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Table Workers
          </h5>
          <p>
            The time cards from the timers and any DQ slips go to
            the Table Workers who determine the order of finish
            for each event, score the meet, and prepare ribbons
            for the participants. Several people from each team
            perform these functions to insure that errors are
            caught before the results are announced.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Team Rep
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Team Rep is the designated recipient of all DQ
            slips for his team and is the only person with any
            official standing to challenge any decisions made by
            the referee. It sounds like an easy job, but
            remember, most of the Team Rep's job is done before
            the meet starts.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Coaches
          </h5>
          <p>
            During the meet, the Coaches primary responsibility
            is to encourage and praise the swimmers and to make
            sure that they get to the Clerk of the Course in time
            to swim.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Other Very Important People
          </h5>
          <p>
            It would be impossible to host a swim meet without a
            number of people in Other Very Important Positions.
            These people run telephone trees, edit newsletters,
            set up the pool and sell concessions. They also
            announce the results, run social activities, act as
            Marshals in the team area and do other jobs that need
            to be done. <strong>We need the help of every family
            in order to have a successful swim season</strong>.

          </h3>
          <p>
            In swimming, the rules must be followed in total or a
            disqualification, or DQ,is committed. This can be
            traumatic the first time a swimmer is DQ'd for just
            one mistake, but it isn't fair to other swimmers who
            swim the entire race per the rules to do otherwise.
          </p>

            What is a DQ?
          </h5>
          <p>
            A DQ (short for disqualification) is any violation of
            the rules observed by any appropriate official. Some

            How will I know a DQ occurred?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Unlike football, we don't blow a whistle and announce
            to the world that a rules violation occurred. When a
            Stroke and Turn Judge observes a violation, he raises
            his hand to signify that he has observed a violation
            then writes it up on a DQ slip. The judge then takes
            the slip to the referee, who verifies that rule has
            been broken and can question the stroke and turn
            judge to ensure that he was able to see the violation
            that was cited. The referee then gives one copy of
            the DQ slip to the Team Rep and another copy to the
            Table Workers. Another clue that a DQ has occurred is
            a Stroke and Turn Judge writing and a longer than
            normal pause between events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Disqualifications for early relay takeoffs are done
            slightly differently. The referee receives all the
            take-off slips from all the judges. If both judges on
            a lane agree that an early takeoff occurred, the
            Referee will write the DQ slip to be distributed.
          </p>
          <h5>
            False Starts
          </h5>
          <p>
            A false start occurs whenever a swimmer moves towards
            the pool after having assumed a still position
            (taking his/her mark) and before the Starter has
            started the race. When this occurs, a swimmer is
            usually trying to anticipate the starting signal and
            beat the other swimmers into the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the false start is detected before the starting
            signal is sounded, the offending swimmer can be
            removed from the race prior to it starting. If a
            false start occurs but the starting signal has
            sounded, the race will not be stopped. Instead the
            false starting swimmer(s) will be notified of their
            false start at the conclusion of the race. The use of
            a recall signal is now limited to a bad start (i.e.
            not all swimmers were ready) or for a safety reason.
            If the starter sounds the recall signal, no swimmer
            can be removed for a false start.
          </p>
          <h5>
            How do I know if My Kid DQ'd
          </h5>
          <p>
            Your kid will probably know before you do since the
            Team Rep tells the coach, who tells the swimmer.
            You'll probably find out if you saw your swimmer
            finish with one of the top three times but he isn't
            announced later in the top three places. Similarly,
            someone else DQd if your swimmer finished in
            4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup>, yet
            is announced as one of the top three finishers.
            Another way to find out is by reading the official
            Meet Results, which are posted at the pool by 4 PM
            the day of the meet. You can also get results by
            visiting the <a href="http://nvsl.nvblu.com/">NVSL
            web site</a> or by reading the Fairfax Journal.

            A Word About Officials and DQs
          </h5>
          <p>
            Every Official on the deck will always give the
            benefit of the doubt to the swimmer. Although the
            difference between legal but ugly vs illegal is
            sometimes close to call, any violation called by an
            official is an "I saw" not an "I think I saw".

            Protesting Disqualifications
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Team Rep is the only person who can officially
            question a disqualification or any other call by an
            official. If something happens involving your
            swimmer, which you do not think is right, talk to the
            coach or the Team Rep. The Team Rep will initiate
            action in accordance with NVSL rules if thought to be
            appropriate.

            <a name="ch8"
                id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8: We'd Rather Have Fun Than
                Be in Division I
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you get to know the parents of swimmers in
            Division I teams, some of them will tell you that
            swimming isn't always fun. At the pinnacle of NVSL
            are the six best teams and they all want to be #1. At
            Virginia Hills, we like to win, but it isn't our
            reason for being. Some of the things we do to have
            fun are:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pep rallies:</strong> Pep rallies are held
            Friday nights before home meets at the pool. Coaches
            will lead swimmers in preparing the pool for the next
            morning's meet: learning cheers, making posters, and
            setting up equipment. It's also an opportunity for
            coaches and the team rep to share news.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Team pictures:</strong> We take a team
            picture every year and we'd like your swimmer to be
            in it. You are not obligated to purchase a picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Other social events:</strong> Over the course
            of the season we'll have a spaghetti dinner, a couple
            of ice cream socials, a trip to a nearby amusement
            park and other fun events.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Swim banquet:</strong> We cap off the season
            with a swim banquet, which is a pot luck dinner held
            at the pool the evening of divisionals. We give out
            awards for season accomplishments and end the evening
            with family relays and team presentations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What's mandatory?</strong> While we hope you
            will participate in all the social activities, they
            are all optional. Similarly, the purchase of team
            suits and other team clothing items is entirely
            optional. What is mandatory is that you honor your
            commitments and have fun!
