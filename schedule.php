    While Virginia Hills Pool prides itself in
    providing an atmosphere for relaxation, it also
    offers a broad range of activities for its
    members. A tentative list of special activities
    planned for the 2009 season follows. Notices
    will be placed at the pool and e-mails sent to
    members during the season confirming these
    events:
