                  While Virginia Hills Pool prides itself in
                  providing an atmosphere for relaxation, it also
                  offers a broad range of activities for its
                  members. A tentative list of special activities
                  planned for the 2009 season follows. Notices
                  will be placed at the pool and e-mails sent to
                  members during the season confirming these
                  events:
