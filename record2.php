        Swim team opened its season yesterday with a win at Pinewood Lake, 285 –
        122.  The big news from the meet was a new team record and this time, it
        was not Paige Collins but rather, Allie Puskar-Beckett.  Allie set the
        record for the 13 – 14 year old girls 50 meter backstroke in 33.82,
        breaking the old record of 33.92 set by Mary Pat Haddock in 1992.
        Allie and her family are new to our pool this summer, having transferred
        in on military orders.  So, congratulations Allie, great swim, and we’re
        mighty glad your family is here!

        Allie Puskar-Beckett AGAIN set another new pool record - this time for
        the 13 - 15 year old girls 50m butterfly, finishing in 32.50.  Allie
        lowered the record by an amazing 2.11 seconds!   Looks like Wonder Woman's
        costume goes to Allie this year - congratulations again, Allie!
