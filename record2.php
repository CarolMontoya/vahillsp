        Swim team opened its season yesterday with a win at Pinewood Lake, 285 –
        122.  The big news from the meet was a new team record and this time, it
        was not Paige Collins but rather, Allie Puskar-Beckett.  Allie set the
        record for the 13 – 14 year old girls 50 meter backstroke in 0:33.82,
        breaking the old record of 0:33.92 set by Mary Pat Haddock in 1992.
        Allie and her family are new to our pool this summer, having transferred
        in on military orders.  So, congratulations Allie, great swim, and we’re
        mighty glad your family is here!
