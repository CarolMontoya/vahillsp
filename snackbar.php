              <p>
                The Snack Bar needs volunteers! Please sign up
                <a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/go/60b0c4fa8a62e5-snack">here</a>
                for time slots.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a reminder, volunteers can choose to earn 2 guest passes for every hour worked, or one $6 snack bar card for every 2 hours worked. (Please note there was a typo in my earlier email regarding the snack bar cards; we do require 2 hours of work to earn each snack bar card.)

              The Virginia Hills Pool Snack Bar will now have regular weekend
              hours on Saturdays and Sundays from 1-6 pm.  We need additional
              volunteers to help us staff other hours during the week and before
              and after those weekend shifts, so please consider signing up to
              help out!
            </p>

              HOT DOGS SERVED DAILY!!! We have a hot dog toaster that allows us to cook up to two hot dogs at a time, ready
              in 2-3 minutes!  Hot dogs can be ordered at any time the snack bar
              is open, and condiments are available in the snack bar. Other hot
              food options offered in the snack bar daily include Macaroni and
              Cheese cups, Cup O' Soups, and our delicious nachos (nachos may
              not be served every day, but we will try to have them out most
              evenings and weekends.)
            </p>
            <p>
              We also have a new, industrial-grade snow cone machine!  Snow
              cones will be served on weekends and at home swim meets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks and we'll see you at the snack bar!,br/>
