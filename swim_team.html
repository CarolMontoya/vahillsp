            The Virginia Hills pool swim team, the <em><strong>Tidal
            Wave</strong></em>, is one of the oldest teams in the 98-team
            <a href="http://nvsl.nvblu.com">Northern Virginia Swimming
            League</a> (NVSL). Children are welcome to join, even if they are
            not strong swimmers now. Practices begin immediately after Memorial
            Day after school hours at the pool. Different times are set aside
            for each age group. Once school ends, practices switch to weekday
            mornings and Tuesday and Thursday evenings.

            <strong>Swim meets</strong> begin on Saturday mornings in mid-June,
            and run through July. There are competitive meets (A meets) on
            Saturday mornings and developmental meets (B meets) Monday
            evenings. This is a fun activity that brings children of all ages
            together to enjoy each others' company and the camaraderie of a
            great team sport. <strong>Pep rallies</strong> are held Friday
            evenings before A meets. <strong>Ice cream socials</strong> are
            held on Sunday evenings following away A meets. Other team events
            include the <strong>team campout</strong>; a trip to <strong>King's
            Dominion</strong>; and the <strong>team banquet.</strong>

          <p>
            <a name="Registration"></a>Swimmers only need to be able to swim
            one length of the pool. If you are not sure about signing up for
            the team and you would like to have your child try it out... then
            feel free to join a practice and let your child "test the waters."
