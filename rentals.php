        The Virginia Hills Club's pool is available for
        rentals. Organizations which would like to bring
        groups, such as daycare classes, into the pool on
        either a regular or one-time basis during normal pool
        hours or in the mornings prior to general openings,
        should send an e-mail to <a href=
        "mailto:info@vahillspool.org">info@vahillspool.org</a>
        stating the dates and times in which you are
        interested.

        The Virginia Hills Club welcomes the opportunity for
        members to host birthday parties, team parties and
        other similar events, during regular pool hours or by
        special arrangements at other times. Arrangements
        must be made in advance by contacting the Club at
        <a href=
        "mailto:info@vahillspool.org">info@vahillspool.org</a>.
        Use of picnic tables, the patio lounge, and access to
        the pool and other facilities are included. Pool
        members can participate in such parties at no charge.
        Hosts should arrange for non-members (adults and
        children) to attend using guest passes. (Members
        receive 10 guest passes with annual dues; additional
        passes are available for purchase.) Guests must be
        accounted for whether swimming or not. Alcohol,
        except at Club-organized events, is prohibited.
