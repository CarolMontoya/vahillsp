            Virginia Hills Club was formed in 1955 and has been a
            fixture in the local community ever since. The new
            renovations were undertaken to serve a membership
            base which has been on the rise since 2004, when the
            Club adopted a long-term plan to improve its
            facilities and increase its membership. To kick off
            the second phase of its long term plan, Virginia
            Hills Club retained an experienced local company &ndash;
            <a href="http://www.NVblu.com"
               >NVblu, Inc.</a> &ndash; to perform the
               pool renovation. NVblu brought to the project over
               25 years of experience in commercial and
               residential swimming pool renovation,
               construction, and repair. By virtue of its
               well-earned reputation in delivering projects on
               time and on budget, NVblu was the hands-down
               choice. NVblu balanced much needed technology
               upgrades while working within imposed budget
               constraints in bringing the renovations to a
               successful conclusion.
