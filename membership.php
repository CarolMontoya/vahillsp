          </h2>
          <p>
            Membership in the Virginia Hills Club, Inc. is
            competitive with other pool memberships in the area.
            In 2009, the club opened with <a href=
            "plans.php">two new pools</a>. The main pool was 
            enlarged, with a diving well, slide, and large shallow
            area; the baby pool got fun new water features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides being a member of a great organization, you
            also own a piece of the pool that is appreciating in
            value! We welcome members, both singles and families,
            from any community in the area. We have welcomed
            members from as far away as the City of Alexandria,
            Beulah Street, Lorton and Hayfield. After reviewing
            the information here, please

          <h5>
            Share Purchase
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Virginia Hills Club, Inc. is owned by its
            members, who are the shareholders in the Club. To
            become a member, either a family or single, pay a
            one-time fee to purchase a share. The share price 
            for the 2011 season will be <strong>$500</strong>. New
            shareholders can pay this amount all at once, or make
            a down payment on the share and membership dues with
            the balance paid in increments through the Club's easy
            payment plan. Payment can be made by check or credit
            card via Paypal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shareholders who terminate their membership by
            informing the Club in writing and requesting a
            buy-back are eligible to have 85% of their share
            price returned to them at a time approved by the
            Club's Board.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Seasonal Dues
          </h5>
          <p>
            Shareholders are required to pay membership fees 
            before the start of every season. The due date
            for 2011 fees is May 8, 2011. The membership
            fee for Family Membership in 2011 is
            <strong>$525</strong>. The membership fee for a 
            Single Membership in 2011 is <strong>$280</strong>. Payments may
            be spaced out in advance of that date. New members
            should also pay seasonal dues. New members whose
            households include extended family members should
            discuss special arrangements with the Membership
            Committee representatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two classes of associate (non-shareholding)
            memberships are available: associate and military.
            Associate Members pay a single-season fee of
            <strong>$760</strong> (no share purchase). If you
            anticipate being in the area or using the pool for
            more than one season, however, it makes sense to
            become a shareholder from the beginning. Associate
            membership fees are likely to increase in future
            seasons.
          </p>
          <h5>
            For Active Duty Military Personnel and Diplomats
          </h5>
          <p>
            The Virginia Hills Club also welcomes military
            families, who only may be in our community for a few
            years. The membership fee for an Active Duty Military 
            Membership in 2011 is <strong>$525</strong> (no share 
            purchase). This benefit can be used for two consecutive 
            seasons. If a duty tour is extended or is expected to 
            last for more than two swim seasons, active duty personnel 
            are encouraged to consider becoming shareholders. 
            Special consideration will be given when such military 
            shareholders rotate out of the area. 
          </p>
          <h5>
            Nanny/Granny Fee
          </h5>
          <p>
            A dedicated caregiver can be added to a household
            membership for <strong>$50</strong>.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Guest Passes
          </h5>
          <p>
            Family and single memberships include 15 guest passes
            per season. Additional guest passes can be purchased
            for <strong>$5 each or $35 for 10 passes</strong>.
