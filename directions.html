            Location
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Virginia Hills pool is located in the Virginia Hills
            development, at 6500 Robinson Drive. Robinson is a short street
            just off Dorset Drive. Dorset Drive runs between Telegraph Road and
            Berkshire Drive within the community, crossing The Parkway, a major
            road through the Virginia Hills community running between Telegraph
            Road and South Kings Highway.

            From the Washington Beltway
          </h4>
          <p>
            Coming from either the direction of the Springfield mixing bowl or
            the Wilson Bridge, exit onto the Telegraph Road heading south.
            Proceed about two miles until Dorset Drive on your left. Turn left
            onto Dorset Drive, proceed up the hill. Beyond the crest of the
            hill look for Robinson Drive on the right. Turn right onto Robinson
            and take the first right into the pool parking lot.
          </p>

            From the Richmond Highway

          <p>
            Coming from either direction, south or north, turn onto Memorial
            Drive (easily recognized by a traffic light and a Goodyear store on
            the corner, with the Beacon Hill Shopping Center's Giant Food store
            in view behind it). Follow Memorial until you reach the first stop
            light, then turn left onto South Kings Highway. Proceed through the
            next stop light and bear right at the third light. Turn right onto
            The Parkway and then take the first left onto Dorset Drive. The
            second left along Dorset Drive is Robinson Drive, where the pool is
            located. Enter the first entrance to the pool's parking lot.

          <p>
            The Springfield-Franconia Parkway, traveling in the east and
            southerly direction, ends at Beulah Street, approximately one mile
            past Springfield Mall. However, continue through the traffic light
            at Beulah onto Manchester Lakes Boulevard a short distance until
            you will see Hayfield Road on the right (there is a short ramp).
            Turn right onto Hayfield Road and proceed to the second traffic
            light, which is at Telegraph Road. Hayfield Shopping Center will be
            on the left and Hayfield Secondary School on the right. Turn left
            onto Telegraph Road and proceed north through three traffic lights
            (the third at the entrance to Lee District Park). After the third
            light, the third right is Dorset Drive (nearly directly across from
            the small commercial electric office). Turn onto Dorset Drive and
            proceed up the hill. Beyond the crest of the hill, look for
            Robinson Drive on your right and turn into it.

            Parking
          </h4>
          <p>
            The pool has a parking lot which normally can hold enough cars for
            regular pool patrons. For swim meets, the parking lot normally
            fills up and parking along one side of Robinson and Dorsett are
            used. Please do not park on both sides or block driveways. For
            major swim meets such as divisionals and relay carnivals, we
            suggest using as overflow parking either the lot behind the old
            Virginia Hills School, which is located on Diana Lane off of Dorset
            Drive a short distance from the pool. Alternatively, you may park
            in the lot between the ball fields at Lee District Park. From
            there, walk down the gravel path away from the main park building,
            past the snack bar/toilet building at the far end of the parking
            lot. The gravel path leads to Robinson Drive and the pool parking
            lot.
