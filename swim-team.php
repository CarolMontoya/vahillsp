            The Virginia Hills pool swim team, the
            <em><strong>Tidal Wave</strong></em>, is one of the
            oldest teams in the 98-team <a href=
            "http://nvsl.nvblu.com">Northern Virginia Swimming
            League</a> (NVSL). Children are welcome to join, even
            if they are not strong swimmers now. Practices begin
            immediately after Memorial Day after school hours at
            the pool. Different times are set aside for each age
            group. Once school ends, practices switch to weekday
            mornings and Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Swim meets</strong> begin on Saturday
            mornings in mid-June, and run through July. There are
            competitive meets (A meets) on Saturday mornings and
            developmental meets (B meets) Monday evenings. This
            is a fun activity that brings children of all ages
            together to enjoy each others' company and the
            camaraderie of a great team sport. <strong>Pep
            rallies</strong> are held Friday evenings before A
            meets. <strong>Ice cream socials</strong> are held on
            Sunday evenings following away A meets. Other team
            events include the <strong>team campout</strong>; a
            trip to <strong>King's Dominion</strong>; and the
            <strong>team banquet.</strong>

            <a name="Registration"></a>Swimmers only need to be
            able to swim one length of the pool. If you are not
            sure about signing up for the team and you would like
            to have your child try it out... then feel free to
            join a practice and let your child "test the waters."
