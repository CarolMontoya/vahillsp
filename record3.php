        What a day the July 5th A meet at Fairfax Club turned out to be. No fewer than 4 Tidal Wave records were broken!
        <ul>
          <li>Allie Puskar-Beckett broke not one but two 15-18 Girls records in her 50 Back and 50 Fly events.  Allie, you make it look easy.  Way to go.</li>
          <li>Our 8U girls freestyle relay team broke a long-standing record from 1980.  Those girls are Ava Beckett, Olivia Calese, Eleanor McNichols, and Inez McNichols.  Well done, girls.</li>
          <li>And finally, one that's been so close for weeks now and she finally smashed it today, Inez McNichols broke the 8&U 25 Fly record that has held since 1985.  Congratulations Inez!  You rock, girl.</li>
        </ul>
